## 🧠 How DataCamp Helped

> DataCamp was instrumental in helping me build the foundational and practical skills required for this project. The courses on **pandas** and **data manipulation** taught me how to clean real-world datasets, handle missing values, and restructure messy data into an analyzable format. The **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** lessons gave me the tools to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in large datasets using both statistical summaries and visualizations. I also learned how to use libraries like **seaborn** and **Plotly** to create both static and interactive charts that reveal meaningful insights.  
>
> Additionally, the structured learning path helped me gain confidence in using **Jupyter Notebooks** to present my analysis in a clear and professional way. Without the step-by-step practice and guidance from DataCamp, I would not have been able to complete this project with the same level of depth, clarity, or confidence.
